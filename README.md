# Decomposition-of-arbitrary-polygon-into-convex-polygon
Decomposing any arbitrary polygon into convex polygon is a well-studied problem. In this repo, I have decomposed an arbitrary polygon into convex polygon and then visualised using python file (vis.py). One just has to give the coordinates in the input txt in clockwise or anticlockwise order. For clockwise set of input, comment the reverse(points.begin(),points.end()) in main() and for anticlockwise, uncomment it.
Just need to compile and run the main.cpp file and all other files will be taken care.
For visualisation run vis.py file and you will be able to see the visualisation.
